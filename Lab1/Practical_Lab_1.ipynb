    "The objective of this lab is to perform univariate linear regression on the California Housing Prices dataset. We'll predict the median house value based on three individual features: median income, population, and number of households. Our goal is to identify which feature offers the best predictive power for median house value using linear regression evaluation metrics.\n"
